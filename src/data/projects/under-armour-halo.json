  "description": "We transformed Under Armour's HALO collection launch into a content-generating machine. An immersive brand activation where every surface, every light, every angle was designed for one thing: to look incredible on camera and drive organic conversation.",
  "client": "Under Armour / Forus",
  "overview": "Under Armour came to us with a challenge: launch HALO—their most innovative collection—in a way that would cut through the noise and resonate with a new generation of athletes.\n\nWe made one thing clear from the start: we didn't want to just do a launch. We wanted to create a cultural moment.\n\nNot just a product reveal. A statement.",
  "execution": "CONTENT-FIRST DESIGN\n\nWe flipped the traditional event model. Instead of designing a space and then figuring out content, we started with the feed. What would make someone stop scrolling? What would make an influencer post without being asked?\n\nEvery decision—lighting angles, LED placements, spatial flow—was made with one question: Will this look incredible on camera?",
  "marketingResults": "The HALO launch delivered exceptional results across every metric.",
