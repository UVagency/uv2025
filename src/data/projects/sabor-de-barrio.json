  "overview": "We carried out a CSR action and outlined a comprehensive communication strategy with the neighborhood as the main ingredient. We went in search of the best 'sopaipillas pasadas' preparation, together with the local Municipality. The first place in this contest was won by the skilled hands of Mrs. Angélica, and the prize was the refurbishment of her neighborhood's community center.",
  "execution": "Representatives of the Chancaca Deliciosa brand actively participated in the renovation of this community center, directly benefiting over 2000 neighboring families. We amplified this social action with a press strategy in various media outlets, and also executed an efficient plan of investment in digital media with high-impact content. We celebrated the reopening of the community center with a vibrant carnival on Sopaipilla Pasada Day, with municipal authorities and the entire community participating in activities and surprises.",
